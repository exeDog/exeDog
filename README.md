### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-time multitasking ninja. 

Just kidding. I am a full stack software engineer, building applications and services for about 7 years. I specialize in Ruby, Javascript (React & Vue), Scala and Node. Got a Masters degree in Information Systems.

In my free time I'm a passionate mixed martial arts practitioner. I practise Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu, preparing for my blue belt. You can also catch me at the gym.
